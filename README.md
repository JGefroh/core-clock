# Clock

Clock is an experiment in 2d psychological horror written in my [core-js](https://github.com/jgefroh/core-js) framework.

It is written in pure Javascript w/ Canvas and WebGL2 rendering and no other frameworks.

It's fully playable at http://clock.jgefroh.com.

This is not intended to be used in a commercial or production environment - it was just a fun hobby project I wrote.
